Read About Constraint Layout [here](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/constraint-layout)

**Important Point to Note**
1. To position a view on the constraint layout, you are supposed to set atleast two constraints.
2. one of these two constraints must be a top contraint or a bottom constraint
3. one of the other constraints must be a left/start constraint or a right/end constraint. 
4. Simply, one constraint on horizontal axis and one constraint from vertical access has to be set.

### Intents in Android

Official Documentation [link](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters)

Basically an intent is a request object that you send to the android system. The android system will look into the request and acts accordingly. 

There are primarily two types of Intents in android
1. Implicit Intents
   -   Implicit intents are those intents that will invoke a system application to complete your request.
   -   Ex: Apps openining maps, youtube, calendar, dailer and other system applications need implicit intents.
  
2. Explicit Intents
   -   An Explicit intents requires to open one of the user installed applications to resolve your request. 
   -   Ex: You want to navigate from one activity to another in your application that your are developing.
