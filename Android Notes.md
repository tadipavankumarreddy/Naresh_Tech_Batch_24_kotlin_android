### Constraint Layout in android
Read About Constraint Layout [here](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/constraint-layout)

**Important Point to Note**
1. To position a view on the constraint layout, you are supposed to set atleast two constraints.
2. one of these two constraints must be a top contraint or a bottom constraint
3. one of the other constraints must be a left/start constraint or a right/end constraint. 
4. Simply, one constraint on horizontal axis and one constraint from vertical access has to be set.
